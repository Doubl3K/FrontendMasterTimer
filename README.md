## Local start

### Quick start

If you have Node.js and npm installed, just copy the following commands into your terminal. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
If everything worked correctly, you should see the npm run dev command just hit
enter and the project will start on localhost:3000.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Doubl3K/FrontendMasterTimer.git
cd FrontendMasterTimer
npm i
npm run dev
```

### By clicking on the minute field the timer can be incramented to 2025.
